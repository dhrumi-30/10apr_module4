*What is File function in python? What is keywords to create and write file.
=>To create a new file in python use the open() method with one of the following parameters "x" 


*How many except statements can a try-except block have? Name Some built-in exception classes:
=>A try-except block in Python can have multiple except statements to handle different types of exceptions.
There is no hard limit on the number of except statements that can be used.

*When will the else part of try-except-else be executed?
=>The else part of a try-except-else block in Python is executed only if 
no exceptions are raised in the try block. 

*Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception?
=>Yes, a single block of except statements in Python can handle multiple exceptions. 

*When is the finally block executed?
=>The finally block in Python is executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

*What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
=>When the expression "1" == 1 is executed in Python, it is comparing a string "1" with an integer 1 using the equality operator ==.

*How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets.
=>you can handle exceptions using the try, except, and finally blocks.
  The try block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the except block handles the exception if it occurs.
  The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
code:
try:
    result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
except ZeroDivisionError:
  
    print("Error: Division by zero")

*What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in java
=>Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction,Encapsulation are concepts of oops.
Java does not support multiple inheritance of classes.

*How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class
=>In Python, we can define a class using the class keyword followed by the name of the class
syntx:
class ClassName:

=>In Python, self is a conventionally used parameter name that refers to the instance of a class. It acts as a reference to the instance itself, 
allowing you to access its attributes and methods within the class.

*Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What Is A Constructor In Python?
=>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a class 
to inherit attributes and methods from another class.
=>In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an instance of the class is created.
It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.


*What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology?
=>In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation refers to the process of creating an instance or an object of a class. 
An instance is a specific occurrence or realization of a class, representing a unique entity with its own set of attributes and methods.


*What is used to check whether an object o is an instance of class A?
=>In Python, you can use the isinstance() function to check whether an object o is an instance of a particular class A. 
The isinstance() function returns True if the object is an instance of the specified class or any of its derived classes; otherwise, it returns False.


*What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?
=>The appropriate relationship between a Course and Faculty can be described as an association or aggregation, 
depending on the specific scenario and requirements.

*What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?
=>In the context of Student and Person, the appropriate relationship is inheritance, specifically a "is-a" relationship.
 A Student is a specific type of Person, representing a specialization or subtype of the more general Person class.
